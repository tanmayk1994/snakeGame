#Snake Game
#This project is from the free Udacity course to develop a pygame. 
#Link: https://www.udemy.com/python-game-development-creating-a-snake-game-from-scratch
#Note: I'm developing this game just for the sake of getting an experience in pygame
#Feel free to download it, and modify it the way you want.


import pygame                       #straighforward importing of pygame
import sys          
import random                       #because the random function is most useful in many games
import time                         #to keep track of certain time units 

#Here, import can also be written as import pygame, sys, random, time
#I just wanted to explain the purpose of each import statement

print(pygame.init())                #initializing pygame
